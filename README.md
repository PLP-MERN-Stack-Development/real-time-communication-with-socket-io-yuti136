Real-Time Chat App

This is a simple real-time chat application built using React (Vite) on the frontend and Socket.io on the backend.
It supports sending messages instantly between connected users, making it easy to test and expand.

📌 What the App Does

Connects users in real-time

Allows sending and receiving messages instantly

Shows when a user joins or leaves

Helps you understand how Socket.io works with React

▶️ How to Run & Test
1. Start the Backend

Default port: 5000

cd server
npm install
node server.js


Your backend will start at:

http://localhost:5000

2. Start the Frontend

Default Vite port: 5173

cd client
npm install
npm run dev


Your frontend will run at:

http://localhost:5173

🧪 How to Test the Chat

Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:5173


Open another tab, OR use another browser.

Start typing messages from both windows.

Messages will appear instantly across all open tabs.
